To create a `values.yaml` file that matches the requirements, you can start with a basic structure and update the `tag` field with the new version number using the Jenkins pipeline script you provided.

Here's a template for a `values.yaml` file that includes an image section with a `tag` field. This template assumes that you're using Helm or a similar deployment tool that utilizes a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
# values.yaml

# This is a sample values.yaml file that contains settings for an image.
# The tag field will be updated by the Jenkins pipeline.

image:
  repository: your-docker-repository/image-name
  tag: "1.0.0"  # Default tag, will be updated by the pipeline
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

### Explanation:

- **image**: This section typically contains details about the Docker image that the application should use.
  - **repository**: The name of the Docker repository where the image is stored.
  - **tag**: The version tag of the image, which will be updated by the pipeline.
  - **pullPolicy**: This specifies when the container runtime should pull the image from the registry. `IfNotPresent` means it will use a local image if available.

### Updating the values.yaml File with Jenkins

Your Jenkins pipeline script snippet will update the `tag` field in the `values.yaml` file with the new version number (`NEW_VERSION`):

```groovy
sh """
sed -i 's/tag: .*/tag: ${NEW_VERSION}/' path/to/values.yaml
"""
echo "Updated values.yaml with new version: ${NEW_VERSION}"
```

### Steps to Implement:

1. **Create the values.yaml file**: Use the above template as a starting point.
2. **Store the values.yaml file in your source code repository**: Ensure the file is under version control so that updates can be tracked and managed.
3. **Set the path correctly in Jenkinsfile**: Make sure the path specified in your `sed` command (`path/to/values.yaml`) matches the actual location of your `values.yaml` file in the repository.

#### Example:

If your `values.yaml` is located in the root directory of your repository, the path in the `sed` command would be:

```groovy
sh """
sed -i 's/tag: .*/tag: ${NEW_VERSION}/' values.yaml
"""
```

Ensure that your Jenkins job has the necessary permissions and environment setup to perform these operations, including Git commit and push if the values.yaml file is under version control.
