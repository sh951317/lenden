Here is an example Jenkins pipeline code to merge a pull request from the dev branch to the master branch:
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    triggers {
        github(
            branch: 'dev',
            events: ['PUSH']
        )
    }
    stages {
        stage('Merge Pull Request') {
            steps {
                // Get the pull request ID from the GitHub webhook
                def pullRequestId = github.pullRequestId
                
                // Merge the pull request into the master branch
                git {
                    remote {
                        name: 'origin'
                        url: '(link unavailable)<your-username>/<your-repo>.git'
                    }
                    config {
                        branch: 'master'
                        merge: true
                    }
                    merge(pullRequestId)
                }
                
                // Push the merged changes to the master branch
                git {
                    remote {
                        name: 'origin'
                        url: '(link unavailable)<your-username>/<your-repo>.git'
                    }
                    config {
                        branch: 'master'
                        push: true
                    }
                    push()
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This pipeline code uses the GitHub webhook to trigger the pipeline when a push event occurs on the dev branch. It then merges the pull request into the master branch using the `git merge` command and pushes the merged changes to the master branch using the `git push` command.

Note: You need to replace `<your-username>` and `<your-repo>` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

Also, you can use `github` step to merge the pull request, it will handle the merge and commit for you:
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    triggers {
        github(
            branch: 'dev',
            events: ['PUSH']
        )
    }
    stages {
        stage('Merge Pull Request') {
            steps {
                github(
                    merge: true,
                    pullRequest: true,
                    branch: 'master'
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This way you don't need to specify the git commands explicitly.
