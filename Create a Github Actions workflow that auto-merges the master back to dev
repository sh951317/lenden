If you’re somehow dependant on having an up-to-date dev branch with the latest tags from the master branch available, you could set this up using Github Actions.

Below is an example workflow file that will do this when a PR to the master branch is closed (and the PR is marked as “merged”).

name: PRs to master
on: 
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]
    types: [closed]
jobs:
  merge-master-back-to-dev:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true
    timeout-minutes: 2
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set Git config
      run: |
          git config --local user.email "actions@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "Github Actions"
    - name: Merge master back to dev
      run: |
          git fetch --unshallow
          git checkout dev
          git pull
          git merge --no-ff master -m "Auto-merge master back to dev"
          git push
